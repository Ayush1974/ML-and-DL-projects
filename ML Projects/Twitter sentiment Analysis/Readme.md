## Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for a Deep Learning project that analyzes the sentiment of tweets. 

### Project Overview

This project utilizes Deep Learning techniques to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. It explores the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:** (Optional) You can implement code to collect tweets using the Twitter API (requires Twitter developer account). Alternatively, a pre-collected dataset can be used.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for the Deep Learning model. This might involve removing noise, stemming/lemmatization, and converting text to numerical representation.
3. **Model Building:**  Developing a Deep Learning model for sentiment classification. This could involve architectures like LSTMs or CNNs.
4. **Model Training:** Training the model on the prepared dataset. 
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Python 3.x
    - Deep Learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
    - Text processing libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
    - Additional libraries might be required depending on your chosen approach (e.g., Tweepy for Twitter API access)
2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://ayush1974@github.com/ayush1974/ML Projects/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Refer to the `requirements.txt` file (if provided) and install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **(Optional) Data Acquisition:**

   - If using the Twitter API, follow the instructions to create a developer account and obtain API keys.
   - Implement code to collect tweets based on your desired criteria (hashtags, keywords, etc.)

5. **Run the project:**

   - The specific instructions for running the project will depend on the implementation. Look for a script named `train.py` or similar, or refer to further instructions within the code.
