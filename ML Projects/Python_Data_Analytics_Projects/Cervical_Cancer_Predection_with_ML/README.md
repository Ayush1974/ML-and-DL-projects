# Cervical_Cancer_Prediction_with_ML

This project builds and trains an XG-Boost classifier to predict cervical cancer risk. Data from 858 patients at Hospital Universitario de Caracas was used, including features like pregnancies, smoking habits, and medical history. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization were performed. The data was prepared and split for training and testing. The XGBoost model achieved:

* **99.562% Accuracy** (Training Dataset)
* **95.348% Accuracy** (Test Dataset)

**Project Visualization (Optional):**
